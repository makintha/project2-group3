<h2>Project Title: New York New York</h2>

<h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>
<u>New York is well known for its City and Iconic Skyscrapers. Do you know that within New York state, there are plenty of parks that are worth visiting? Yes, in this project, our team will be looking at all the State Parks within each county in New York State.
</u>
Our Goal is to create a Dashboard that contains the State Map of New York, boundaries of each county,  containing these layers - Pinpoints of each state park, heatmap of each county’s population, their median income and each of the state park’s attendance. We will also be including an interactive bar chart showing the State Park’s attendance of each year.
